  "project_overview": "Rio Preto-Jacundá REDD+ (Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation) project is a partnership between Biofílica and the residents of Resex (Extractivist Reserve) Rio Preto-Jacundá. This project provides shelter to more than 450 flora and fauna species and was established in the early 90s. Its community has a long history of fighting for territorial rights and is a pioneer in creating a Conservation Plan for the area. Following decades of struggle, the residents of the region sought to survive among an area high in biodiversity though scarce of basic public services. The solution was found in the commercialization of environmental services in order to generate income while continuing to value the forest. The aims of the Jacundá Project range from local empowerment and the improvement of the quality of life of the local population, to the monitoring of vulnerable species, enabling a continuous process of knowledge development and observation of local biodiversity.",
