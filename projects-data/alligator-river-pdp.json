  "project_overview": "The project is comprised of 2,750 acres of forested land in the tidal region of northeastern North Carolina adjacent to the Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge. Most neighboring properties have been harvested, burned on site and then converted to agricultural land for crop production such as wheat and corn. If this land had not been placed under easement this rich and diverse ecosystem would have suffered that same fate. The proceeds from carbon revenue are used to fund the continuing management and natural restoration of this forest. The Project offers additional environmental benefits in the form of wetland conservation and protection of habitat bordering the Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge.",
