  "project_overview": "The project is located 20 miles southeast of Mount Shasta in Northern California. Co benefits such as protection of local water quality and habitat protection for sensitive species are achieved while timber is sustainably extracted to support the local economy. This project covers approximately 9 000 acres and comprises the largest working conservation easement west of the Rockies. It ensures that 15 square miles of forest and 8 miles of the famous McCloud River will be forested and productive in perpetuity. The McCloud River project provides a sustainable and protected habitat for rare, threatened, and endangered species such as the Northern Spotted Owl, Bald Eagle, Roosevelt Elk, and Black Bear. The project also connects to the Shasta Trinity National Forest, providing critical habitat corridors for many species.",

Each easement requires constraints on forest management activities that are above and beyond those required by the Forest Practice Rules. This restriction on forest management activities will occur in perpetuity, and the project developer has demonstrated, through the use of forest modeling, that such restrictions are likely to lead to increased GHG reductions relative to the baseline scenario. Project activities exceed the applicable mandatory forest management laws used to characterize the project baseline, the project can be determined to be additional in accordance with the Forest Project Protocol. Finally, the Attestation of Voluntary Implementation, attesting that the project has been voluntarily implemented for the duration of the reporting period, has been properly executed by an appropriate representative of the project proponent.",
