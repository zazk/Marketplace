  "project_overview": "Placed under a conservation easement with the USDA, the Pocosin Lakes Projects ensure that the natural land will not be disturbed by human development such as burning, digging, plowing, draining, or planting crop. In the absence of this protection, the forest would have been harvested, burned on site, and converted to agricultural land for wheat or corn crop production, similar to neighboring properties. The management practices of the project allow the forest to regenerate naturally, which will promote and maintain a diversity of native species and forests comprised of multiple ages and mixed native species at multiple land cape scales. The project sequesters around 15 000 metric tons of CO2 per year. The project provides a sustainable and protected habitat for the mixed hardwood and conifer forest, as well as the animals that live within it. The project also supports healthy populations of red wolf, bald eagle, black bear, and neotropical migratory bird species.",
