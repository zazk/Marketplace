By reforesting land, we're helping to bend the climate curve, restore species habitat, clean the water, and support the local and global economy.  ",

Discussion with federal land management agencies, consulting foresters, landowners, and investigation by GreenTrees legal counsel has revealed no law or regulation requiring afforestation of agricultural lands in the region, concluding that the project activity is not legally required. GreenTrees demonstrated that without carbon finance, the project would not have gone forward or would have had a below-market rate of return on investment.",

    "Social and Economic Co-Benefits": "The GreenTrees Projects will provide sustainable income to low-income landowners. As former U.S. Senator Blanche Lincoln from Arkansas said, “The GreenTrees reforestation program is a win-win for the landowner, the land and the Delta region. As we move toward a new energy economy rural areas cannot be underestimated.”",
    "Water Quality Co-Benefits": "Water quality will greatly benefit from afforested riparian buffers. Reforestation minimizes soil erosion and absorbs farm chemicals from surface runoff and groundwater. Furthermore, reforestation reduces sediment and pesticide contamination of streams.",
    "Biodiversity Co-Benefits": "Reforestation restores wildlife habitat. Studies on the effects of reforestation in the Mississippi Alluvial Valley have shown that reforested land contains significantly more varieties of species as compared with land that has not been reforested. A study by the U.S. Forest Service states that the type of planting that GreenTrees performs holds twice the amount of birds than other forms of reforestation."
